The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Assignments\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `assignments/assignment_1/` folder structure. Update your navigation menu to include:\n\n```\n- text: Assignments\n  menu:\n    - href: assignments/assignment_1/your_file_name.qmd\n      text: \"Assignment 1: Census Data Exploration\"\n```\nIf there is a special character like comma, you need use double quote mark so that the quarto can identify this as text\n\n# Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load required packages (hint: you need tidycensus, tidyverse, and knitr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# Set your Census API key\ncensus_api_key(Sys.getenv(\"MY_CENSUS_API_KEY\"))\n\n# Choose your state for analysis - assign it to a variable called my_state\nmy_state <- \"OH\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n**State Selection:** I have chosen **Ohio** for this analysis because it is my home state!

Since the ACS relies on sample data, rather than the total enumeration provided by the Census, small population groups will result in small sample sizes. \n\nIn this scenario: Any algorithmic system should account for the data inaccuracies arising from Ohio's smaller counties.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\nselected_counties <- county_data %>%\n  filter(county_name %in% c(\"Cuyahoga\", \"Marion\", \"Vinton\"))\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nkable(\n  caption = \"Selected Counties (1 in each reliability category)\",\n  selected_counties %>% select(county_name, median_incomeE, median_income_moe_pct, median_income_moe_cat),\n  col.names = c(\"County Name\", \"Median Income Estimate $\", \"Median Income MOE %\", \"Median Income MOE Category\")\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Selected Counties (1 in each reliability category)\n\n|County Name | Median Income Estimate $| Median Income MOE %|Median Income MOE Category     |\n|:-----------|------------------------:|-------------------:|:------------------------------|\n|Cuyahoga    |                    60074|            1.163565|High Confidence: MOE < 5%      |\n|Marion      |                    55106|            8.313069|Moderate Confidence: MOE 5-10% |\n|Vinton      |                    50967|           12.290306|Low Confidence: MOE > 10%      |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** Cuyahoga county is one of the most populous counties in Ohio, so the sample sizes used lent to its low MOE of ~1.16%. Although this **can not** be extrapolated to all counties, it is interesting to see a decline of median income as the MOE increases among the selected counties. \n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.

The last chart highlights that, with both communities having a higher MOE as a percentage of tracts being marked.\n\nFor Marion and Vinton counties, this is potentially explained by Black and Hispanic populations being a smaller percentage of the total. This would make the sample sizes for both communities fairly small in these counties. In Cuyahoga county, a visual inspection reveals tracts being flagged when they have small percentages of Hispanic, Black, or White population.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nAcross the analyses, a pattern emerges: the MOE for demographic data is highly sensitive to both the population size of census tracts and the demographic composition within them. Small-population counties, such as Vinton County, show particularly large MOEs due to limited sample sizes in the ACS. Similarly, tracts with highly diverse populations tend to have inflated MOEs across multiple demographic groups, making nearly every group susceptible to high uncertainty in the estimates.\n\nIn examining equity implications, Black and Hispanic populations face the highest risk of unreliable data. While the largest MOE observed for White populations is around 200%, Black and Hispanic populations frequently have MOEs in the hundreds of percent and, in extreme cases, as high as 2000%. This suggests that algorithmic decisions relying on this demographic data can be highly unreliable for these communities.\n\nWe can classify the root causes of these data issues into two categories. First, small sample sizes in low-population tracts and counties amplify MOEs for all estimates. Second, demographic variability can take the form of both extremely small minority populations *and* highly heterogeneous tracts. This further inflates MOE. An example is Census Tract 1711.02, which is nearly 87% Black but flagged as “High MOE” because the MOE for the White population exceeds 40%.\n\nTo address these systematic issues, decision-makers should incorporate demographic composition into analyses, weighting MOEs appropriately when interpreting the demographic data. Underrepresented communities should be prioritized for follow-up investigations at the tract or county level to better understand them. By acknowledging and adjusting for these data limitations, we can improve the equity and reliability of policy decisions.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# -

In counties with small or underrepresented populations, certain communities may face higher margins of error, and in highly diverse counties, careful attention or additional algorithmic analysis is needed.\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** Adams, Athens, Carroll, Champaign, Clinton, Coshocton, Darke, Fayette, Gallia, Guernsey, Hardin, Harrison, Henry, Highland, Jackson, Knox, Lawrence, Marion, Meigs, Monroe, Morgan, Morrow, Paulding, Perry, Pike, Preble, Sandusky, Van Wert, Wyandot.\n- These counties can be further categorized based on population and demographic characteristics. In counties with very small populations, targeted local outreach may be sufficient to understand community needs. In larger or more diverse counties, more granular analysis at sub-county levels may be necessary to ensure accurate insights and equitable decision-making.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** Noble, Vinton. \n- These counties have some of the lowest populations in Ohio, making traditional ACS estimates highly uncertain. Given the small population size, targeted local outreach—allowing for larger effective sample sizes than the ACS—may be the most feasible approach to accurately assess community needs.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\nThe relationship between demographics and population size in determining MOE warrants further investigation. The current analysis, which applies MOE cutoffs based on either demographic or county-level data, involves tradeoffs and may exclude or underrepresent certain populations. Developing a cutoff that incorporates both population size and demographic characteristics could provide a more accurate and equitable assessment, rather than relying single, uniform metrics.\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package in September of 2025 (final run conducted on September 28th 2025)\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13)\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-kakumanus/\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nNothing of note in this analysis.\n\n**Limitations:**\nFor algorithmic decision-making at the state government level, this analysis serves as an initial assessment, providing key considerations rather than providing a final solution. \nFurther exploration is needed, particularly because relying on ACS-based estimates can inadvertently exclude populations—especially in counties where demographic characteristics make sampling approaches less reliable.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [x] All code chunks run without errors\n- [x] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [x] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [x] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [x] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [x] Census API key is properly set \n- [x] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
